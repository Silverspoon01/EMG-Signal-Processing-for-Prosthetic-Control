# EMG-Signal-Processing-for-Prosthetic-Control
This project uses Digital Signal Processing to simulate virtual hand control via electromyography (EMG) signal analysis. It involves phases like feature extraction, classification, and preprocessing, including Butterworth filtering and Haar wavelet analysis to enhance surface EMG data for precise hand movement analysis.
